# Bisection Algorithm

This repository implements the Bisection algorithm in Python for finding the maximum of a given mathematical function. The Bisection algorithm is a numerical method used for root-finding and optimization, particularly in situations where the derivative of the function is not readily available.

## Features

- **Bisection Function**: The core implementation of the Bisection algorithm, allowing users to find the maximum of a given function within a specified range.
- **Visualization**: The repository includes visualizations (using matplotlib) to help users understand the behavior of the algorithm and observe the convergence to the maximum.

## Usage

1. **Load Libraries**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed using `pip install matplotlib numpy sympy`.

2. **Bisection Function**: Define your function and use the provided `bisection` function to find its maximum.

3. **Visualizations**: Explore the provided visualizations (Figure 1 and Figure 2) to gain insights into the function and the algorithm's behavior.

4. **Customization**: Feel free to customize the code to fit your specific use case or integrate it into larger projects.

## Examples

Check the example usage in the README to understand how to apply the Bisection algorithm to a specific function.
